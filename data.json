Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide, no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes, look up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\n[Verse 2]\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)\nI don't wanna die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all"
